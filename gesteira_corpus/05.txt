CFB The word 'democracy' comes from ancient Greek words 'demos', which means 'people' or 'district', and 'kratos', which means 'power' or 'government'. In Athens of 6th and 5th Centuries B.C a democratic system was developed and became a model for all modern democracies around the world. In that context large groups in Athenian population were put aside of government, like women and slaves, even so, everybody considers Athens as the mother of democracy.
